# fresh-macos-install

Hi there. Somehow you stumbled on my fresh _macOS setup script_.

This is a WIP tool to automate setting up a new device.

## Todo

Add these to be configured automatically:

* accessibility ->      enable dragging without drag lock
* dock & menu bar ->    hide dock by default
* keyboard ->           enable to move focus between controls
* trackpad ->           swipe between pages -> swipe with 3 fingers
* trackpad ->           set up right-click to bottom right  
* displays ->           Scaled for more space
